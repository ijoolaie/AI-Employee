# AI Employee World — Master Handoff
**Updated:** 2026-10-12  
**Status:** World viewport framing accepted on exact-head CI screenshots; follow-up engineering remains open.

## Current source of truth
- `main` contains PR [#1062](https://github.com/ijoolaie/AI-Employee/pull/1062), merged as `d6e4f9297dbf7122aab22bdf8bbea467a6f8f038`.
- Code head validated before merge: `7dd0a54709a6b8660dc7fb3d32051160ac50fbb2`.
- Exact-head visual artifact: [`world-visual-review-10d00b30be9cfc784398ed8a3c4380328684ee3f`](https://github.com/ijoolaie/AI-Employee/actions/runs/38292198575). The 1440×900 desktop and 390×844 mobile screenshots were inspected.
- All five required workflows passed on that exact source head:
  - [CI / Playwright](https://github.com/ijoolaie/AI-Employee/actions/runs/38292198575)
  - [CodeQL](https://github.com/ijoolaie/AI-Employee/actions/runs/38292198505)
  - [Ephemeral DAST](https://github.com/ijoolaie/AI-Employee/actions/runs/38292198517)
  - [HA Failure Recovery](https://github.com/ijoolaie/AI-Employee/actions/runs/38292198352)
  - [Production Infrastructure Validation](https://github.com/ijoolaie/AI-Employee/actions/runs/38292198497)
- PRs #1059 and #1060 were closed as superseded by #1062. Dependency PRs #1063, #1066, #1065 and #1064 were also merged after their exact-head checks passed.
- Release certification is unchanged: latest certified tag remains `v1.4.17` at `b403c0dcdea579e017738a6fdea138c2b1a2999c`. The World merge is not a new production release.

## What changed
- Fixed Tailwind scanning to include `frontend/features/**`, which had omitted responsive utility styles from feature components.
- Consolidated the procedural executive avatar, procedural surface materials, camera pan helper and tests, consistent reset/default camera distance, continuous side-wall backing and floor palette correction.
- Desktop framing now leaves margin around the office perimeter/front floor edge. Portrait multiplier is 1.65; the mobile view fits all five department platforms in the reviewed screenshot.
- Mobile camera controls use compact Reset/Full labels in the upper-right; the HUD stays upper-left and joystick stays bottom-left. Pointer cancellation resets movement.
- Extracted ground collision footprints into `frontend/features/world/WorldNavigation.ts`.

## Verification actually present
- Playwright checks mobile HUD/camera/joystick bounds, console/page errors and unexpected HTTP 5xx responses.
- Playwright performs a real pointer drag and checks that the rendered 3D canvas changes.
- Existing World E2E coverage checks keyboard movement to locked-room proximity, room offer/renewal flows and server-authorized room access.
- Unit tests cover coffee-table/workstation footprints, walkable aisle space and office bounds.
- These checks passed on the exact code head listed above. The CI screenshot review establishes responsive framing, not every gameplay/navigation behavior.

## Explicit limitations — do not overstate completion
- Employee models remain procedural. A GLB/GLTF employee runtime loader is not implemented or claimed.
- Collision geometry is a conservative footprint guard with axis-separated sliding; it is not full obstacle-aware pathfinding or arbitrary-route navigation.
- Walk-cycle foot planting and richer authored employee/workstation assets remain follow-up work.
- World remains a read-only projection of authorized business data. Do not invent employees, revenue, orders, approvals, entitlements or room access client-side.

## Next actions
1. Reconcile and merge the fresh documentation-only PR after its checks pass; the older #1058 docs branch is stale and will be superseded.
2. Prioritize authored/licensed character assets with provenance and verified runtime loading, if approved.
3. Design and test obstacle-aware navigation and more comprehensive collision integration tests.
4. Keep release certification separate from World code merges.
